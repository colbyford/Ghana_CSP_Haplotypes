## Abstract
Today, the RTS,S malaria vaccine only provides partial protection (~$36%) against _Plasmodium falciparum_ in certain sub-Saharan African countries such as Ghana, though this vaccine previously showed efficacy well above 60\% in previous clinical trials. Our study analyzes the diversity of the _PfCSP_ gene across 88 samples from Ghana and we have derived 27 prevalent haplotypes. We further investigated these haplotypes by understanding how variations in this gene affect protein binding interactions with human immunological proteins (a human leukocyte antigen and a T cell receptor). By predicting and quantifying these interactions, we then created a candidate list of haplotypes that were validated using _in vitro_ assays. Our findings may suggest potential sequences on which a next-generation malaria vaccine can be based.
